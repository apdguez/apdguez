Hi!! I'am @apdguez, just arrived here trying to create something for you. Currently working as Systems Engineer, 
my main focus will be Model-Based Systems Engineering, Architecture Frameworks and random stuff about SE. 

ðŸ“« Any thoughts or ideas are always welcomed; you can reach me and text me on LinkedIn 

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SE with other engineers about MBSE, AF, ontology or metamodels ðŸ‘€

Thinking to create also some "Out Of Context" posts about anything, related or not about SE, we will see
